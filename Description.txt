My soundscape narrative is a timeline of earth and human history. So far I have added many nature sound effects such as rain, bird sounds, and thunder. I have been experimenting with fading in and fading out sound effects. The last thing that I added was monks praying, to make the sound a little more musical I added tribal drums to the praying. I am very happy with my progress so far, and I am getting better at using the tools audacity has to offer.
